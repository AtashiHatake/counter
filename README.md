Created a basic counter using JavaScript functions and event listners

Learnings :
1) How to create simple but effective function.
2) Using event listners to count up/dow or reset to zero.
3) How to add colour (green, red or no colour) when up counting, down counting or reset.

It is a very basic and easy project but it taught me a key things about styling using DOM (classList.add, classList.remove) and it taught me basic logic of functions.
